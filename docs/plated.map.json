This zine started out as a need to see the typefaces i have installed on my machine to make it easier for me to choose for pairings in projects.</p>\n<p>At the moment, i&#39;m just listing the weights and variants of each type spread over 2 pages. There are some links included; download links usually to the foundry and Google Fonts where most of these fonts are found and links to the type designers&#39; website or behance portfolio for more information about the font itself.</p>\n<p>For now, this fits a purpose but it would be really good to include information about the designers themselves though i know this will increase the time to publish. Easier said than done when i&#39;m struggling to find information about the very first typographer on the list!</p>\n",

A few ideas came and left but i knew i wanted to make another Bradford zine in some shape or another.</p>\n<p>The radio format isn&#39;t surprising - it&#39;s something i&#39;ve always been a little obsessed with - so it <em>somewhat</em> fully formed into a fictional radio station in the satanic mills sending out signals and stories about Bradford. Could work, right? eh.</p>\n<p>Anyways, i was thinking maybe this one could be in A6 format so it&#39;ll be a teeny zine. It also makes the zine feel a teensy bit more personal, to me anyways; ie. it doesn&#39;t feel unwieldy to read in my small hands.</p>\n"
