In the following posts, i attempt to find data outlined in the linked papers below by listing the processes and going through them carefully.

If you find anything out of place, please comment below. This is still a work-in-progress so bear with me as i get my head around it.

It's a learning curve to understand how data is used and applied in different sectors and i'm not at all familiar with Agroecology.

As mentioned in the paper by *Pimbert and Moeller*, there is no sector code or identification in IATI for an activity that 'promotes agroecology' and this, in turn, makes it more difficult to filter out activities that do fit the base requirement for any further analysis.
