<span class="date">Oct 2025 - Plug It Up</span>
[Plug It Up](https://bradfordsoundwomen.wordpress.com/plug-it-up/) is a DIY sound art festival combining workshops and performances led by female &amp; marginalised gender artists who are working with sound in innovative ways. Really chuffed to have been a part of this ambitious event, the first of its kind in Bradford and by such a tiny team.

<span class="date">July 2025 - Imagine Zine Space</span>
We, Loosely Bound zine collective, took over Trapezium Arts space for two days to make zines together during International Zine Month, thanks to some funding by Creative Lives. We feel lucky to have had this opportunity and think all spaces should do this for their community!

i'm always looking out for ways people are using d-portal. Reports from data analysis usually include comments on user interface and methods to extract the needed data from the site. This is where the most valuable feedback comes from and by going through the processes, we are able to learn where things are lacking. This, in turn, allows us to better the platform further. ~ shi

i also write zines, riso and do some manner of type, poster and graphic design, all of which are a lot of fun and totally different to the usual stuff i do. You can purchase my zines below.
