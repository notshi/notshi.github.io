i'm always looking out for ways people are using d-portal. Reports from data analysis usually include comments on user interface and methods to extract the needed data from the site. This is where the most valuable feedback comes from and by going through the processes, we are able to learn where things are lacking. This, in turn, allows us to better the platform further. ~ shi
