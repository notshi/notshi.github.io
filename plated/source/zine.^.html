i've been working on a couple of zines that are not yet fully published.

### The week before and after
A collaboration with Farah Varouqa, this zine is a collection of our daily lives as migrants in the city we live in; during and after the week when the COVID-19 lockdown was announced in the United Kingdom.

### Typograp.her
Typograp.her is a collection of opensource typefaces created and designed by womxn. This zine started out as a need to see the typefaces i have installed on my machine to make it easier for me to choose for pairings in projects.

At the moment, i'm just listing the weights and variants of each type spread over 2 pages. There are some links included; download links usually to the foundry and Google Fonts where most of these fonts are found and links to the type designers' website or behance portfolio for more information about the font itself.

For now, this fits a purpose but it would be really good to include information about the designers themselves though i know this will increase the time to publish. Easier said than done when i'm struggling to find information about the very first typographer on the list!

None of my zines are on etsy but i'm looking at getting them distributed somehow, possibly through Distros and/or digital platforms.
