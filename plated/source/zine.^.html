i've been working on a few zines, some more finished than others.

### BD666
This one has been simmering in the backburner for a month now. A few ideas came and left but i knew i wanted to make another Bradford zine in some shape or another.

The radio format isn't surprising - it's something i've always been a little obsessed with - so it *somewhat* fully formed into a fictional radio station in the satanic mills sending out signals and stories about Bradford. Could work, right? eh.

Anyways, i was thinking maybe this one could be in A6 format so it'll be a teeny zine. It also makes the zine feel a teensy bit more personal, to me anyways; ie. it doesn't feel unwieldy to read in my small hands.

### The week before and after
A collaboration with Farah Varouqa, this zine is a collection of our daily lives as migrants in the city we live in; during and after the week when the COVID-19 lockdown was announced in the United Kingdom.

### Typograp.her
Typograp.her is a collection of opensource typefaces created and designed by womxn. This zine started out as a need to see the typefaces i have installed on my machine to make it easier for me to choose for pairings in projects.

At the moment, i'm just listing the weights and variants of each type spread over 2 pages. There are some links included; download links usually to the foundry and Google Fonts where most of these fonts are found and links to the type designers' website or behance portfolio for more information about the font itself.

For now, this fits a purpose but it would be really good to include information about the designers themselves though i know this will increase the time to publish. Easier said than done when i'm struggling to find information about the very first typographer on the list!
